### SEO plan for improvements and optimization. (For Assignment 10)
If I had infinite time and resources to dedicate to SEO optimization, I would perform the following:

* Create a Meta Search and Meta Title with meaningful/creative sentences so users will be more likely to click on it. This is the information that populates on a google search page when it has been identified as possible relevant content.
* Use Google Search Console as a tool to analyze network traffic and possible improvements that can be made. (Many Youtubers highly encourage using this.)
* Adding more internal links and more <a> tags with <hrefs> to work on link building. Apparently this is something that Google uses frequently when identifying useful pages for search results.
* adding keywords from my website impressions identified from the Google Search Console into my website naturally. 
* Have multiple additional keywords in the title and meta description. This would help me reach a broader audience as they search for content on my website.
* Focusing on good content. Most of my content will be on the "family" page, and I believe the information will speak for itself. Since my site is mostly about my family, I dont suspect (or expect) to advertise my content to a massive general audience.
* Understand more about important concepts and theories about SEO and how it is prioritized and generated. Some examples would include calculating click-through rate (CTR), Impressions (when it shows up on a search page), position (where it showed up on the page), how a user reads through a google search page, etc. Great example for understanding what happens if people search for multiple web content on the same page: (https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7042828?hl=en)
* considering other formats to show content on my page. I was reading about how different content formats reach different audiences. For example, if some folks enjoy reading blogs, I'll have links to my blogs section, but then also create a link to youtube videos to my channel to talk about the blog (perhaps like an event recap, or informing family of things that are coming up soon).

### SEO plans already implemented:
* OG meta tags for social media sharing.
* explicity naming the charset to utf-8.
